# Simple Convolutional Neural Network for Multi-Class Image Classification

## Overview
This project aims to develop a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for multi-class image classification. The concept of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) draws inspiration from nature, where birds have inspired us to fly and fish have inspired us to swim. In particular, the study of Deep Neural Networks has been influenced by the human visual cortex system.

## Abstract
Abstractâ€”Nature has inspired countless inventions, birds have
inspired us to fly and fish have inspired us to swim. It was with
this logic the concept of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was
developed which through research developed in study of Deep
Neural Networks inspired by human visual cortex system. In
this article we prepared a basic architecture of Convolutional
Neural Network for a Multi-class image classification and fine
tune the parameters such as learning rate to find the most optimal
parameters for accurate class predictions. The baseline model did
not achieve a great validation score signifying overfitting. Using
Normalization and Regularization techniques did not show any
significant improvement in model accuracy. However, applying
transfer learning methods using VGG-16 architecture improved
the validation accuracy by 32%.
